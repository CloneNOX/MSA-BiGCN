Emergency &lt; Mayday|||||@damienramage @airlivenet No, then you would say PANPAN. Trust me, I'm a pilot! Besides: Mayday is when lives are in danger...|||||@airlivenet @PollyR_Aviation @crislomb Looks terribly off course on a map. Nothing earlier? Like much earlier?|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet but isn‚Äôt declaring an emergency the proper procedure if you still have control of the situation ?|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet or think you do ? or it hasn‚Äôt been assessed ?|||||@airlivenet @PollyR_Aviation So sad...prayers to the families and friends...|||||@damienramage @airlivenet Normal descend rate for A320 is 2500fpm. Now 4000fpm (for 8 minutes) which is much, but contrallable. #u4u9525|||||@damienramage @airlivenet Plus they stayed more or less constant speed, which means they reduced throttle, so they were in control #u4u9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet exactly. So emergency would be appropriate, for example in case of cabin decompression, right ?|||||@damienramage @airlivenet That would certainly explain why pilots set steap descend. Maybe they passed too quickly (oxygen masks?) #u4u9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet real question is, how long before the crash did they call out the emergency|||||@damienramage @airlivenet By the way: Cabin pressure loss in an airliner is a classic case for MAYDAY ! #4u9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet if they had, it‚Äôs likely the descent rate would‚Äôve been steeper and the speed not reduce, no ?|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet true...|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet what‚Äôs the exact procedure btw ? What altitude would you drop down to ? at which rate of descent ?|||||@damienramage @airlivenet At that altitude you have about 20 sec before you pass out. They started steep descend, reduced engine... #4U9525|||||@damienramage @airlivenet immediately manual (autopilot off), throttle, oxygen masks + passngrs, radio call. All that in 20 seconds? #4U9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet radio call then passengers, no ? 20 sec isn‚Äôt much‚Ä¶ it takes me longer to tweet sometimes ;-)|||||@damienramage radio call to passengers: not a priority at all !!|||||@damienramage I've seen friends with nasal oxygen masks on (General Avation), just to fly over the Channel :)|||||@PascalSyn that's just for the high|||||@damienramage yes, and they have a bottle behind them with this tube connected. But it looks very stupid LOL|||||@PascalSyn @damienramage @airlivenet What about icy sensors and software telling autopilot to dive as happened with AF447?|||||@larsst @damienramage I don't know about that. Graphs don't show a sign of leveling off at a certain altitude.|||||@PascalSyn @larsst plus af447 was exceptionnal weather conditions|||||@PascalSyn @damienramage With iced sensors it won't level off. Apparently a computer glitch - pilot would need to override system manually|||||@damienramage @PascalSyn GW flight had same descent rate as near crash LH flight. Check  or|||||@damienramage @airlivenet From Airbus FlightOps: When the cabin altitude rises above 14 000 feet, the oxygen masks will deploy automatically
