Stop the political correctness!! Enough is enough!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews How can you deport them when they ARE  canadian??? Deport them where?|||||@JWadeMoses @daryldavis41 @CTVNews  Daryl, Did they get him ?|||||@Slater363 @daryldavis41 @CTVNews He was killed at the Parliament.|||||@Slater363 @JWadeMoses @CTVNews Yes he was shot dead...|||||@daryldavis41 @JWadeMoses @CTVNews  Good ! Do they know if he acted alone ?|||||@Slater363 @JWadeMoses @CTVNews not sure.....still fluid situation|||||@daryldavis41 @JWadeMoses @CTVNews  I guess at this point that makes sense. Thank you for the info, I appreciate it.|||||@JWadeMoses @daryldavis41 @CTVNews  Thank you for the info !|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews I think you are implying that this person is of Arabic background.. That's kinda prejudice don't u think?|||||@CTVNews @garretmeikle Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's name is Ukranian-French, not middle-eastern. Bibeau is a French surname.|||||@CTVNews @garretmeikle Jonathan, that photo is fake, put up be trolls and fearmongers. NO photo has been released by police yet. Get a clue!|||||@JWadeMoses @CTVNews CBS &amp; Dailymail conf his name.|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews They're not Canadians who were born here. They do not deserve to be Canadian. Back where they/their family came from.|||||@TheBeast_175 @CTVNews Nope, not prejudiced just a fact. Sorry if that FACT bothers you!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews Actually, you are wrong. They ARE born here. And they ARE bred here. So they ARE canadian just like you and me!|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews Nope. They don't deserve that right. I can't believe you stand behind these people. Are you for real??  Very sad!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan nope doesn't bother me any. Just wanted to confirm your ignorance, and I did. Thanks!|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews + even if they were not born here, they hold a cdn citizenship so they're canadian. There's not 2 class of citizens.|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews Did that soldier deserve to die!!?? Whose rights are you for?? Hope your friends and family know where you stand.|||||@TheBeast_175 Glad you think my loyalty to my country and peaceful citizens is ignorance. You're a loser!!|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews who cares what they hold. They don't deserve to hold it and should be stripped of it. WOW|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews I don't stand behind them, but i don't believe in 2 types of citizens. if you are cdn you are cdn.|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews you will face they canadian law like any citizen if you commit a crime period|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews Sorry. Not if you're a terrorist!!! Unbelievable!!!|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews That's a joke!!!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews I disagree on this. So when You commit a crime, should i strip you of your citizenship?|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews You are so ridiculous. Just listen to yourself!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan he was a Canadian citizen dumbshit. What's your definition of being Canadian???|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews Of course that soldier did not deserve to die. They same way someone killed in a robbery does not deserve to die.|||||@TheBeast_175 Not being a terrorist you dumb fuck!!! Glad you stand behind these people!! What about the soldier that died? Is that a joke?|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews Not the same thing at all. You're quite ignorant!!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews Me being ridiculous is your opinion. I just don't agree with your opinion. A candian is Canadian not matter what.|||||@yensidltaw @CTVNews And that's your bleeding heart opinion. Good bye!!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan wow u seriously need to learn to read and stop jumping topics. I grieve for the fallen solider and his family, but your poor..|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews Sure, of course i'm ignorant. The fact is there're laws, u commit a crime, u are punished. not striped of ur ctzship|||||@cdnmickeyfan choice of words like "deport them" is the issue here. The gunman was a Canadian, how do you deport someone who is from here??|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews bye|||||@yensidltaw @cdnmickeyfan judging from his responses, i think he has a hard time comprehending what he reads. Forgive him.|||||@cdnmickeyfan oh I get it your definition of being Canadian is one that doesn't include people of mid-east descent #thatsprejudice|||||@TheBeast_175 @cdnmickeyfan I seriously don't get that shortcut.  I say he can't deport them and all of a sudden I'm a behind criminals...|||||@TheBeast_175 @cdnmickeyfan I sincerely hope that is NOT  his definition of being Canadian.|||||@yensidltaw @cdnmickeyfan something tells me he's an idiot and that something are his tweets lol|||||@TheBeast_175 @yensidltaw First of all you idiot I'm a female. Second maybe you will read yours and ask yourself how Canadian you really are|||||@yensidltaw @TheBeast_175 My definition of being Canadian is to love this country and it's citizens. Very sad yours is NOT!!|||||@yensidltaw @TheBeast_175 Robbing a bank and being a terrorist are two totally separate things.|||||@TheBeast_175 @yensidltaw You're an ignorant asshole. I have no problem with comprehension!!|||||@cdnmickeyfan @yensidltaw lol who taught you English in school?? They need to be fired. One of the dumbest ppl I've seen on twitter hahaha|||||@TheBeast_175  oh and you definitely aren't a "good dude".|||||@cdnmickeyfan I think you are slightly demented, just slightly. You hop topics faster than you hop dicks. So have a bad day and FUCK YOU|||||@cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 Killing someone no matter ur intentions behind the killing is the same to me.  U commit a crime, u face the law.|||||@cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 You are not stripped of your citizenship in either cases.|||||@cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 Sorry just saw thisWhat u just defined is being patriotic. Which is different from citizenship (at least to me)|||||@cdnmickeyfan To be clear I love my Country &amp; the people who fight for itI'll not condone prejudice nor the notion of 2nd grade citizens
