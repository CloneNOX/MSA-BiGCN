Emergency &lt; Mayday|||||@damienramage @airlivenet No, then you would say PANPAN. Trust me, I'm a pilot! Besides: Mayday is when lives are in danger...|||||@airlivenet @PollyR_Aviation @crislomb Looks terribly off course on a map. Nothing earlier? Like much earlier?|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet but isn‚Äôt declaring an emergency the proper procedure if you still have control of the situation ?|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet or think you do ? or it hasn‚Äôt been assessed ?|||||@airlivenet @PollyR_Aviation So sad...prayers to the families and friends...|||||@damienramage @airlivenet Normal descend rate for A320 is 2500fpm. Now 4000fpm (for 8 minutes) which is much, but contrallable. #u4u9525|||||@damienramage @airlivenet Plus they stayed more or less constant speed, which means they reduced throttle, so they were in control #u4u9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet exactly. So emergency would be appropriate, for example in case of cabin decompression, right ?|||||@damienramage @airlivenet That would certainly explain why pilots set steap descend. Maybe they passed too quickly (oxygen masks?) #u4u9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet real question is, how long before the crash did they call out the emergency|||||@damienramage @airlivenet By the way: Cabin pressure loss in an airliner is a classic case for MAYDAY ! #4u9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet if they had, it‚Äôs likely the descent rate would‚Äôve been steeper and the speed not reduce, no ?|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet true...|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet what‚Äôs the exact procedure btw ? What altitude would you drop down to ? at which rate of descent ?|||||@damienramage @airlivenet At that altitude you have about 20 sec before you pass out. They started steep descend, reduced engine... #4U9525|||||@damienramage @airlivenet immediately manual (autopilot off), throttle, oxygen masks + passngrs, radio call. All that in 20 seconds? #4U9525|||||@PascalSyn @airlivenet radio call then passengers, no ? 20 sec isn‚Äôt much‚Ä¶ it takes me longer to tweet sometimes ;-)|||||@damienramage radio call to passengers: not a priority at all !!|||||@damienramage I've seen friends with nasal oxygen masks on (General Avation), just to fly over the Channel :)|||||@PascalSyn that's just for the high|||||@damienramage yes, and they have a bottle behind them with this tube connected. But it looks very stupid LOL|||||@PascalSyn @damienramage @airlivenet What about icy sensors and software telling autopilot to dive as happened with AF447?|||||@larsst @damienramage I don't know about that. Graphs don't show a sign of leveling off at a certain altitude.|||||@PascalSyn @larsst plus af447 was exceptionnal weather conditions|||||@PascalSyn @damienramage With iced sensors it won't level off. Apparently a computer glitch - pilot would need to override system manually|||||@damienramage @PascalSyn GW flight had same descent rate as near crash LH flight. Check  or|||||@damienramage @airlivenet From Airbus FlightOps: When the cabin altitude rises above 14 000 feet, the oxygen masks will deploy automatically

They are giving info that the media asked for.|||||@jlpauk @flavius217 They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting|||||@rui_xu @jlpauk also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media.|||||@rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime!|||||@spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system.|||||@spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.|||||@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.|||||@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.|||||@flavius217 @rui_xu Are you saying they start at the end and don't explain why he was approached by cops?|||||@flavius217 I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same?|||||@dissuade p sure you know the answer to that question.|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.|||||‚Äú@flavius217: It appears that #Ferguson PD are trying to assassinate Mike Brown's character after literally assassinating Mike Brown.‚Äù|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I don't think i did say that.

Not worth the bullets whatsoever.|||||@flavius217 @spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . .|||||@flavius217 Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves.|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?|||||@dissuade I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 an investigative report on the shooting?|||||@flavius217 White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops.

I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.|||||@flavius217 Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 There are several witnesses.

Was that made up? How do you know?|||||@EdRandis @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire more then one witness has described the same story In the same way|||||@xstryfex @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire if you know a cop, talk to them, I'm amazed more don't lose it in situations.|||||@xstryfex @Paydental1 @COACHKtoLA @gretawire and if it did happen like that, he will be punished.

Reasonable discussion isn't your thing.  And hearing one side of the story is how you judge a court?|||||@gretawire Well no wonder that cop shot him 9 times while he had his hands raised.

He maybe thought that's why he was being stopped?|||||@Animaleyz not following why that's important?|||||@MikeKrupka I'm wondering if that maybe contributed to the struggle starting? Of course we'll never know the answer for sure.|||||@Animaleyz from what I gather, he was walking down street, kneeled down with hands in air before being shot. No struggle.|||||@MikeKrupka one video of a guy said he was eyewitness, said they fought in the car, a shot rang, he knelt and was then shot in the head.|||||@MikeKrupka OK I misunderstood it. No struggle, but Brown was in the police car at one point.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so wouldn't the police car be close to the body in the pics? Or he move the car?|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka that's what I wonder, but this guy says Brown was in the car|||||@Animaleyz Lots of eye witness accounts right now, guess to your point earlier, probably won't ever know truth for sure.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Yup, I watched that ... absolutely crazy shit|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka wouldn't open. But I saw 2 witnesses that said different|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton only thing I dispute is that the police were called, and were looking for him. But Wilson didnt know about that.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton he said cop passed him walking, put it in reverse, and then got out and shot him multiple times while kneeling...|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and I call BS on anything they say, and don't believe he was inv the car. How much sense does that even make?|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton he said at first he shot into the car, Brown got out and knelt, then cop shot him 9 times.|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka this is the witness that said that|||||@MikeKrupka @Animaleyz so y'all saying 2 different stories. Looking at same video?|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka IDK maybe I'm having trouble understanding him|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Who shot into the car? I took it that the cop shot into his own car while trying to get out, causing Brown to kneel|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Greg, try opening in a browser...|||||@MikeKrupka @Animaleyz the cop shot out the car at Mr. Brown, then got out car and shot again|||||@MikeKrupka @Animaleyz I seen it yesterday.

Maybe I'm wrong|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz  --- try that link Greg|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka ok I got it wrong|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka cop shot while in car. Got out.

Did anyone hear Wilson say anything?|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka he's not speaking, and won't speak. Police department and lawyers made sure of that|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Yup, 5th amendment rights; didn't file paperwork either|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka they said today He didn't even write incident report. Which was weird in itself. Everyone should be fired|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton by writing the report, he'd be providing evidence against himself.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Yup. Question is, which citizens have video evidence? OR better yet, will FBI have ability to pull up satellite cam?|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka one thing I disagree with that guy in that video about is Brown didnt look like he did nothing. Grabbed clerk...|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka by the shirt and shoved him, clerk was trying to stop him. But that doesnt justify death by any means.|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton what satellite cam?|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton You don't think the FBI can pull up satellite video of any corner of the globe they wanted to?|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton they dont have satellite imagery of everywhere. Thats physically impossible.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so is it 100% proven that that's him in the video? Guy in video looks 50 pounds heavier to me|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka his friend in the video admitted he was in the store getting cigars, but disputes Brown was stealing them.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka Plus. 5 mins walking in sandals?

Plus no cigars found on him. ‚Äù|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka that's BS too imo|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz It could just be "smoke" / lame attempt to shift focus from murder to robbery.|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton yea Police chief admitted Wilson didnt know about the robbery.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton I know it can be done, but you may be right in that the cams would already need to be focused there.|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka witness from the video admitted Brown was there. That much I didnt misunderstand lol|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton if the feds could surveil the entire US and world, there would never be any fugitives.|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz I walk in flip flops everyday, that looks like about 6 - 8 blocks or more, no way that's done in 5 minutes walking.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka no. The witness said he was at the corner store, not at the QT. Watch again...|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton IDK what to tell ya, the guy says it clearly. Just says Brown wasnt stealing.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Not true. Not everything some in open. They can see what they want, but they need to be focused on the location.|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Yeah, he was saying it was a different store...|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka watch again. You heard wrong|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka well either way it had nothing to do with the shooting, so it's irrelevant|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka clearly says he was at Ferguson Market...|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka where did the robbery happen?|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka quick trip|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka police report says clerk indicated the suspect left and walked TOWARDS quick trip.|||||@tjholmes He left an illness call to take a robbery call in the area, according to the Police Chief.

Cop went looking for the...|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka robbery suspect at the Quik Trip, but that isnt where it happened. Clerk said suspect left store and went that way.|||||@Animaleyz if out was him, and he was picked up. How much time would he have gotten? 0, first (cont)|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Interesting.|||||@agentlinton IDK officers responding to the theft say they never found suspect until he was dead, identified him as Brown and his friend...|||||@agentlinton was there also, seen in video, identified as Dorian Johnson.|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz goes back to stealing cigars shouldn't equal being shot dead, especially since officer had no idea about that...|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton of course not, we've reiterated that. But a Quik Trip was burned down because of this, hope it wasnt a franchise.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka insurance covers a building and the goods inside.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka even if it was a franchise... Or is qt different?|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton didn't know it was burned down?

I was replying to your racist comment above.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ It seems to me that many non Black people are focused on the civil disturbances more than the dead kid.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ I think that's awful and self centered.  They are making it all about them and how they are affected.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ But that would never happen to their kid so they don't really seem to care.  It's upsetting.|||||@ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ The whole situation is awful. The officer should be held accountable for his action.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Absolutely!  The looting is unfortunate but I'm not going to judge those people.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ If I lived there I can't promise that I would react differently.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ So many people are interested in raking the protesters over the coals instead of looking ...|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ at what caused their reaction.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Thanks for listening.|||||@ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ We should never as people respond to a crime with crime.

We are Americans.|||||@joshmhump @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ I agree.  I hope the Ferguson PD comes to the same conclusion|||||@ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__  It's too many, that's for sure.|||||@ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ BTW - you said "white people love the victim card" and I felt judged because of my skin color.|||||@LibertyIsALady @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef boo fucking hoo join the club.

So you're saying every white person is racist.|||||@joshmhump @petee224 @ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef I clearly said prejudice.|||||@LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ I don't know you personally.  I judge people as individuals.|||||@LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ But if I had to make a generalization about WP it would be that most of them harbor some racism.|||||@LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Based on my personal experiences, 39 years of observations, history and current events ...|||||@LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ most people would objectively come to the same conclusion.|||||@LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Me blowing smoke up your behind would not do anyone any good.|||||@ShannonLeeKiss @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__  Sad.  Nonetheless, I'll stand for your rights.|||||@LibertyIsALady @WyzeChef @AdmireLaniya__ Stand for the Constitution and the American Dream.

Cops shoot unarmed people all the time if they are threatened.

Stick to major news outlets (and take with grain of salt).|||||@decyberdiva A wise man once said: "Believe your eyes, not the lies." I don't see Brown paying for anything.

First of all... It's an actual LOGICAL FALLACY (it's a philosophical term). Second of all, it's a fallacy that...|||||@decyberdiva ...discredits generalizations.|||||@slow17motion since when? Since Michael Brown was shot? Strong-armed robbery is robbery using a weapon.|||||@slow17motion There's no such animal as a "Strong-arm" robbery.|||||@decyberdiva Let's be real... It has a lot to do with the threat a person poses. Bieber = minimal threat. Guy who is angry and 6'4"...|||||@decyberdiva Um. Yes there is. It's a legal term.|||||@decyberdiva|||||@slow17motion Robbery is theft using threat of DEADLY Force.|||||@decyberdiva No--it's not. You're obviously not a lawyer.|||||@slow17motion This isn't remotely what happened in this situation.|||||@slow17motion LOL. Now that's funny!|||||@decyberdiva Theft is the ABSENCE of force. Robbery is any application of force, even a nudge can bump it from theft to robbery.|||||@slow17motion Yes, it it. For it to be robbery, there must be fear of deadly harm.|||||@decyberdiva This is pointless. Just look it up. I'm through here.|||||@slow17motion Oh, please!|||||@decyberdiva|||||@decyberdiva QUOTE FROM WEBSITE: Robbery is a violent crime, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the victim has to suffer any type of injury|||||@decyberdiva It‚Äôs enough to commit a robbery if you use any type of force to take property from someone|||||@decyberdiva I hope you're an adjunct, because if not, you're a fucktarded law professor.|||||@slow17motion The operative word here is violent. I never said a word about an injury. I said FEAR.|||||@decyberdiva NOWHERE IN ANY LAW BOOK does it say robbery involves the threat or application of DEADLY FORCE.|||||@decyberdiva Go ahead, prove me wrong.|||||@slow17motion LOL!!! Whatever...|||||@decyberdiva So you're arguing that the legal definition of robbery vs. theft is contingent upon the victim's "feelings" LOL|||||@slow17motion FEAR. That's F-E-A-R.|||||@decyberdiva You said the threat of DEADLY FORCE is required. It's absolutely NOT.|||||@decyberdiva Um, the victim doesn't have to FEAR FOR HIS/HER LIFE for it to be a robbery, you jerk. LOL. You're ridiculous.|||||@slow17motion Absolutely. Fear of violence doesn't mean being pushed. Give me a break.|||||@decyberdiva In fact, the person doesn't have to FEEL anything. It's robbery if force or the THREAT OF FORCE is used.|||||@decyberdiva It's an act of violence. So, yes, that's included under FORCE.|||||@slow17motion If I walk into a store and say give me all of your money or I'll push you‚Ä¶.that's a robbery???? PUH-leaze.|||||@decyberdiva Actually, even if he HADN'T pushed him, if he took something then WALKED HIM DOWN, that's still robbery. Research is fun.|||||@slow17motion Great. See you in court.|||||@decyberdiva It's a threat of violence AND you're taking something in the person's control. Yes, that's robbery.|||||@decyberdiva Well, it's robbery once something is taken.|||||@decyberdiva If you walk into a store, shove the clerk, and take a candy bar. It's robbery. If you take the candy bar and sneak out, theft.|||||@decyberdiva I'd hope so, you're a hot mess.|||||@slow17motion Hey, we define violence differently. And of course, depending on who's doing what, we'll label it differently.|||||@decyberdiva (I'm not defining it. I'm letting the LAW define it. That's why I'm giving sources...)|||||@slow17motion You know, like the boys sleeping in the car in the video I posted were plotting a robbery, according to 9-1-1 calls.|||||@slow17motion Ah, but he didn't walk into the store and shove the clerk.|||||@decyberdiva Two issues: Stereotyping shouldn't ever occur. Stereotypes are not always baseless. (The second one makes me racist, right?)|||||@slow17motion He didn't walk into the store and threaten the clerk either.|||||@decyberdiva Let me give you an example. Many people think all gay men are lisping, mincing fairies. I'm not. However--it's not baseless...|||||@decyberdiva ...many gay men are lisping, mincing fairies.|||||@decyberdiva If you're a police officer--you're not supposed to use racial profiling (or security at an airport)... However, there is reason|||||@slow17motion He walked up to the register. There doesn't seem to be any altercation at the counter.|||||@decyberdiva to profile. Who's more likely to blow up a plane? A middle aged man of middle eastern decent--or a 95 year old white woman?|||||@decyberdiva You're making suppositions. Fact is, it's unclear. Johnson doesn't dispute a crime happened. All sources reporting (like|||||@decyberdiva dailykos) are trash. It looks like a strong arm robbery to me. You disagree. We should move on from this.|||||@slow17motion except for the 9-1-1 bombers had European passports, dyed hair and didn't look middle eastern.|||||@decyberdiva  Unless they completely changed their faces, they looked middle eastern. lol.|||||@slow17motion LOL. Suppositions? You mean like the ones you're making?|||||@slow17motion You're right. These are suppositions! &amp; they shouldn't matter. The policeman didn't know anything about the convenience store|||||@decyberdiva What I'm getting to is this. 1/11 black men are in prison. 1/45 white men are in prison. 11-12% of Americans are black. They|||||@slow17motion We see the same things and yet see different things. That's human nature and that's the problem here.|||||@decyberdiva make up 40% of the prison population. It's not COMPLETELY absurd that cops would use these statistics and profile.|||||@decyberdiva No, it's not RIGHT. It's stereotyping--but it makes logical sense. Sad but true.|||||@slow17motion That is why there is such unrest in Ferguson right now. Because I never know when what you're seeing isn't what I'm seeing.|||||@decyberdiva There's unrest because the popular narrative is that a white police officer gunned down a young black man for no reason.|||||@slow17motion MOST crime is committed by whites. Blacks go to jail more often than whites for the same offenses.|||||@decyberdiva (And for a smaller percentage of protesters there's unrest because, hey, who doesn't love flat screens?)|||||@decyberdiva Doesn't mean that's what happened. We don't KNOW what happened.|||||@decyberdiva True. Whites are the majority of the population.|||||@slow17motion indeed.|||||@decyberdiva Blacks go to jail more often. Also true. That could account for some of the discrepancy. However, even if it counted as HALF of|||||@decyberdiva the discrepancy, that would still mean a black man is twice as likely to commit a crime as a white man.|||||@decyberdiva Much of it has to do with economics.|||||@decyberdiva Economically, black men tend to be more likely to live in poverty.|||||@slow17motion Ummm. Gunned down an unarmed man. The reason matters little.|||||@decyberdiva Regardless of the reasons, though--black men are still statistically much more likely to commit crime. Hence profiling.|||||@slow17motion Sorry. Faulty math there.|||||@decyberdiva Sad? YES. Unfair? ABSOLUTELY. Logical? Well..yeah.|||||@decyberdiva No, it's not. If 1/11 black men are incarcerated vs. 1/45 white men, that means that 10% of black men are imprisoned. 2% white.|||||@decyberdiva I discounted HALF of those crimes for reasons you mentioned: 5% black men vs. 2% white men.|||||@slow17motion That only proves what I said earlier, that black men are arrested and convicted for situations white men get away with.|||||@decyberdiva So, in a way you're right. An individual black man, statistically would be MORE THAN TWICE as likely, discounting 1/2 of crimes|||||@slow17motion You can't supposed from that any greater propensity for crime. Sorry.|||||@decyberdiva Actually... You absolutely can. Mathematically it's true. I don't think melanin has anything to do with it though.|||||@decyberdiva I argue that economics and a culture that glamorizes crime have to do with it.|||||@slow17motion Nope. Not true. Sorry.|||||@decyberdiva Also, the war on drugs increased all incarcerations significantly.|||||@decyberdiva You don't like math?|||||@slow17motion Statistically, since there are more white people and they commit the majority of crime...|||||@slow17motion you are more likely to stumble across a criminal by targeting white men.|||||@decyberdiva Yes, we're talking PERCENTAGES though.|||||@decyberdiva If you're talking about profiling, you're talking about likelihood, that mean's PERCENTAGES.|||||@decyberdiva No, you're not. If you took 100 white men and 100 black men, statistics show only TWO white men would be criminals. (10 black)|||||@decyberdiva Yes, there are MORE white people. But that is irrelevant to the point I'm making.|||||@decyberdiva Are there MORE white criminals? YES! There are WAY MORE WHITES. Are they more LIKELY to be criminals. NO. Not by a longshot.|||||@decyberdiva It's about PERCENTAGES (profiling is ALL about percentages)|||||@slow17motion You can twist percentages around to mean a lot of things.|||||@decyberdiva Blacks make up nearly 1 million of the 2.3 million prison pop. in the US. That's 6x more than whites. Statistically, it has|||||@decyberdiva been predicted that 1/3 black men will spend time in prison during their lifetimes. (Most for non violent drug offenses.)|||||@decyberdiva I am an advocate for short term sentences for non violent offenders and legalizing marijuana. I dislike profiling immensely.|||||@decyberdiva However, I understand why it is used.|||||@decyberdiva No, this is pretty cut and dry. It's not statistics from disputed studies of small populations. This is from census data.|||||@decyberdiva Every man and woman should be judged as an INDIVIDUAL. Every man and woman has the right to due process--regardless of race.|||||@decyberdiva This includes ALL black men...and yes, Darren Wilson too. Being a policeman is not an easy job and they're easy to demonize.|||||@decyberdiva How about we wait to demonize this one until the facts are in? If he's guilty--demonize away.|||||@slow17motion Not for legalizing marijuana at all. sorry.|||||@slow17motion Not demonizing. However, paid leave is hard to stomach.|||||@slow17motion And there's a history of problems in Ferguson that go beyond one incident.|||||@decyberdiva I've never tried marijuana--but I know from personal (family) experience, that it doesn't ruin life quite like booze.|||||@slow17motion Alters brain chemistry, mood altering, kills memory, brain cells..|||||@decyberdiva Of course it's mood altering. That's the point. Brain cells are not killed. At worst it increases the speed at which the brain|||||@decyberdiva deteriorates with age. The most respected studies show that THC does NOT kill brain cells with daily or even heavy use.|||||@decyberdiva It's actually healthier than cigarettes (which are physically addictive, THC is not), and it does less damage than booze.|||||@slow17motion Psychiatric effects of cannabis ||||||@slow17motion Psychology Today: Marijuana addiction is real ||||||@slow17motion Marijuana, brain disorders and schizophrenia ||||||@slow17motion  All of the experts agree it causes the amotivational syndrome and decreases memory...|||||@slow17motion 10 Reasons to stay away from weed. 8. Lower IQ. 10. Personality changes|||||@slow17motion American Medical Journal: Pros and cons in one post ||||||@decyberdiva I'm in my thirties. How would it impair my development? I'm not suggesting kids use it regularly. Adults should have access.|||||@decyberdiva 10. People are nicer on weed. Fact.|||||@decyberdiva It's ironic you'd cite one very biased source to show ALL EXPERTS AGREE (they don't).|||||@decyberdiva It's as real as any mental addiction. It's not physically addictive.|||||@decyberdiva Nobody is arguing that marijuana doesn't have some negative effects. It's still better than booze, which is legal.|||||@decyberdiva Honestly, the negative effects are minimal and manageable if used with caution and care.|||||@slow17motion Again, I disagree.|||||@slow17motion Nope. Not a fact. Weed causes permanent personality changes and can cause irritably and aggressiveness.|||||@slow17motion Sorry you need to tell this to someone who hasn't seen the opposite first hand.|||||@decyberdiva I've known plenty of potheads that function just fine and are active, intelligent people.|||||@decyberdiva THC is like anything else--if you abuse it, it's going to have negative effects. Same with booze, cigs, fatty foods, etc.|||||@slow17motion thats like saying i know plenty of alcoholics that function just fine..|||||@slow17motion|||||@decyberdiva everyone knows that white men tend to get killed by white men and black men by black men. Not new.|||||@slow17motion Great. This entire exchange started over my comment about using black-on-black crime as a subterfuge.|||||@decyberdiva what are you talking about?|||||@decyberdiva you really aren't very good with deciphering our giving meaning to statistics|||||@decyberdiva ask yourself why black on black crime might be a focus of media attention and white on white crime isn't.|||||@decyberdiva the answers are all there in the statistics. All you need to do is think about them.|||||@decyberdiva of interracial crime, blacks commit 85%. Many times more likely to commit homicide. Black on black violence is a problem...|||||@decyberdiva disproportionately, black men commit violent crimes. It's a problem that needs a solution. Hence the media focus.|||||@decyberdiva read up|||||@slow17motion stop the lies...|||||@slow17motion the way to fix this is to stop stripping the wealth from black communities|||||@slow17motion disproportionately property values are devalued in black communities, disproportionately black incomes are predominately less|||||@slow17motion this is nonsense. this is why my children need protection from twisted thinking like yours.|||||@decyberdiva Regardless of the reasons, there are more black criminals. It's not exactly a lie. I mentioned economic factors.|||||@decyberdiva You wonder why property values are lower in black neighborhoods? See earlier statistics.|||||@decyberdiva You can blame the gov't, the economy, schools, whatever. In the end, you have to acknowledge that violence is a PROBLEM in...|||||@decyberdiva ...black communities. Nobody is going to ride in and save them. They need to save themselves. The best way is to change the...|||||@decyberdiva ...cultural values in these communities, reduce drug use and gang influence, and encourage higher education.|||||@decyberdiva You didn't find this funny?|||||@decyberdiva  (The source I meant to post.)|||||@decyberdiva You post one european-centric white supremacist website and EVERYBODY thinks you're a racist. #jokez|||||@slow17motion|||||@slow17motion|||||@slow17motion YOu watch way too many movies. Don't believe every music video you see.|||||@slow17motion Sorry. Devaluation came before crime.|||||@slow17motion Sorry. I know better than this.

Guerena's family won lawsuit, but Tucson sheriff won reelection anyway.|||||@caldodge @scATX if he's "been given bad info before" and publicly states that bad info, that is called "lying"|||||@r4v5 @scATX Not if he doesn't know it's bad info at the time.|||||@r4v5 @scATX If somebody tells you something that's not true, and you repeat it (because you thought it was truth), does that make you liar?|||||@caldodge @scATX depends on the obligation one would expect you to do due diligence before passing on lies, no?|||||@r4v5 @scATX It's called delegation. Person in charge expects underlings to do gruntwork of due diligence.|||||@scATX @MaraWritesStuff - unpopular opinion incoming. Would this have been as big, if the police officer was dead instead?|||||@r4v5 @scATX I'm not asserting police chief IS telling truth. I'm saying he COULD have thought story was truth at time.|||||@Gorbles @MaraWritesStuff What is your point?|||||@scATX - because making an emotive tweet on a tragic death isn't the best presentation of it. I doubt it'd have been done for the officer.|||||@Gorbles An unarmed kid was shot dead in the street, his body left for hours, and the police keep changing the story. EXCUSE MY EMOTING.|||||@Gorbles why the fuck does it matter what would be done if it had been the officer? IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN; THE KID WAS UNARMED.|||||@Gorbles you wanting to change the story to make this about the not-dead or not-even-injured or not-arrested cop is ridiculous derailing.|||||@Gorbles also it's not an opinion.|||||@scATX - sorry for that impression, I don't want to make it about the officer. I want objective views, not emotive tangents. Nothing more.|||||@Gorbles idea that anything can be "objective" is false. And the idea that "emotion" somehow means "not trustworthy" = WHATEVER|||||@Gorbles @scATX Not sure why you think anybody gives a fuck what you "want".|||||@scATX - Twitter's crap at letting me get it all out decently. Basically, reminding people someone's dead is pointless. Everyone knows (1/2)|||||@scATX - you're in a position of authority, and you're using that to leverage this view. Just my opinion, I'm not the only one to reply.|||||@Philosopher_Dad - nor you. Personal attacks aren't the best way to conduct yourself, yo.|||||@Gorbles it's not pointless. And fuck yeah, I am leveraging my opinion. It's my Twitter account. I should apologize for this?|||||@scATX - not at all, sorry again. I'm offering my opinion like you were offering yours. That's all. I didn't even expect a reply!|||||@Gorbles surprise!|||||@scATX @Gorbles This. we are made up of emotion. Objective is often a code for male/real/white.|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX - we are indeed, but ya need to consider things without emotion sometimes. Judges don't rule on emotion!|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX hahahahahahaa sure ok, player|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX I think you really need to study "objectivity" and question that concept.|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX @Gorbles his profile states 100% dolt. we have our answer.|||||@scATX @JulieGillisTX - sure thing. I'm young, I've got plenty to learn.|||||@meadowgirl - in joke, community-related. It's funny how quick people jump to insults though :/|||||@Gorbles Yo, go fuck yourself, yo.|||||@Gorbles waaaa waaaaaa poor widdle white dude feefees. yawn. don't make it about emotion! suck it up!|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX yeah, definitely no "emotion" in the way the criminal justice system pursues alleged cop killers either.|||||@meadowgirl - I'm not. It's funny. Having to resort to personal attacks in order to bait some kinda rise.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - definitely a huge problem. The biggest problem here though is a lack of transparency all round.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - not that I ever stated what my feelings on the #Ferguson situation was. Death is awful.|||||@Gorbles yes, yes bc you are clearly the smartest, best and more deserving of humanity. yes, we know white man, it is about YOU here.|||||@meadowgirl - more about me than you, given the attention I'm getting. Peace out.|||||@Gorbles @scATX If you really think that you need to go back to school. Everyone absolutely does, unless they are sociopathic.|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX - if a judge ever sent someone to prison because the judge didn't like the defendant, then that's unlawful.|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX - deciding without emotions on occasion != devoid of emotions (sociopathy).|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX don't know what your point is. People are emotional when someone's shot. If it's a cop, cops are emotional.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - original point was lost somewhat, no worries. People are emotional, never disputed that.|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX when it's a kid, people who empathize with kids are emotional. There is no emotion-free perspective.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - when observing the situation, then you have to have more of a clear head.

Don't fight a cop - that's what got him killed.|||||@robert10826 @corbinbluwaffle here we have a male using a police description of what happened over 3 eyewitness accounts|||||@thelegendzion @corbinbluwaffle Ya an eyewitnesses are the most reliable.

At the time Muhammed and followers were being tortured and constantly attacked.|||||@StDxCorrosive defending themselves seems pretty rational and justified, wouldnt you agree?|||||@StDxCorrosive Said what?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive That idolaters should be stone.|||||@HA45z they may loathe gays but at least they don't hang them.Your point is invalid|||||@lemonscrolls you said that I believe gays should be hung, I said I don't? How is my point invalid?|||||@HA45z don't deny the truth go to any Islamic country and say you're gay and they will kill you|||||@StDxCorrosive you aren't answering my replies that disprove yours and now you're changing the topic to stoning?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive No, I'm sorry I only saw the other reply. I'll go back and read the other replies.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive Defense vs going to another country in another time and killing possibly innocent people is different.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive War could be justified then, but when they set off bombs at a marathon or kill reporters in Paris its uncalled for.|||||@lemonscrolls it is forbidden in the Quran to be gay. It is forbidden in the bible too and punishment for it there is also death.|||||@StDxCorrosive Yes you're right, the US government and extremists do do this often. As well as the jews in Israel killing palestinians|||||@HA45z the difference is Christians don't actually do it|||||@StDxCorrosive we dont know if boston marathon was a hoax by government and in both it was a case of extremists, not true followers of islam|||||@lemonscrolls Yes, apparently they don't follow what God wants them to do, the God they claim is all knowing|||||@HA45z exactly because they realise that it is stupid|||||@lemonscrolls if you choose to believe in God/a religion you cannot just hand pick what of it you want to believe in|||||@lemonscrolls also this discussion is time consuming and going nowhere. Let us agree to disagree and be done with it :)|||||@HA45z agreed.....faze4life

The whole world isn't in the west|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Just because it is a delicate subject does not mean that it should be ignored.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan Guess what? France is in the West.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan Well here, I respect people but not their beliefs if they don't warrant respect. Simple.|||||@Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale  nobody is forcing you to be like us. You don't have to respect us BUT BE TOLERANT OF US!!!|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan no we see worse ... Remember the Norwegian catholics who killed about 100 in a youths camp ? He was labelled 1/2|||||@AidanRoyale @BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan yes it is. West isn't necessarily a geographical region|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston If you want to be tolerated, learn to tolerate gays, women, Jews, and Christians.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale says who? We aren't out killing people. Is that more noble than printing a picture?|||||@BRANNAN88 @AidanRoyale  I wouldn't go out of my means to insult Christianity.  I've get better things to do. This pple had an "agenda"|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan as a psychopath... But if they are even muslims who might have dont it, they are extremist and terrorist !!|||||@AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston I'm respectful of all people irrespective of sexual orientation,  religion,  and race|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan Just accept people you will get your feelings and 'prophet' trodden upon.. Doesn't mean you get..|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston But your religion is not|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan to throw tantrums and murder innocent people..if you were so comfortable in your religious faith..|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan You wouldn't care what anyone says about Islam. Simple.|||||@ljnicholls74 @liberal_leftie in the US this is carried every couple of month !! But they are catholics and so they're sick and nt terrorist|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale An Agenda? In comic satire? People poke fun at all religions, you just can't take it because it's yours.|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan don't misunderstand me.NOT all muslims are terrorists. but at the moment all terrorists seem to be muslims|||||@ljnicholls74 oops. Israel? Northern Ireland?|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale Id challenge Islam because it is a violent religion in its most basic form. Same with Christianity.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @BRANNAN88 That agenda being Islam.|||||@Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale  I think at your age you know that western media has got an agenda muslims|||||@Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale religion and individuals are separate entities|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan he was a lunatic. isis is a group that target vulnerable people because they can't fight back|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale they need more of an agenda. #religionofpeace|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan thats bcz the media labels any attack carried out by muslims as a terrorist attack !! But any attacker who isnt|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan is considered a sick person !! In the us school shootings and cop killings happens every couple of months but bcz|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston The media in our countries does whatever means necessary to protect Islam from criticism.|||||@AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston I doubt you've read on islam or read the Quran. Making accusations on things you don't know about is ignorance|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan they r nt carried out by muslims ... They r nt terrorist attacks !!|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Exactly, which is why I do not tolerate your religion.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Why do so many verses call for death?|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan once again they are lunatics who don't quote 'god is great'|||||@AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston evidence?|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan look at there targets. beslan. school in pakistan ,river of blood in syria, kidnapping of young girls in nigeria|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but do u consider them as terrorists ??|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan why dont u consider isis as lunatics bcz they are !!|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i know all their crimes ... Is it really different from mass murdering children at a youths camp ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan BECAUSE THEY HAVE STATED IT IS FOR A NEW ISLAMIC STATE!!! like i said, i know not all muslims are murderers|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan all people who commit acts that terrorizes should be called terrorist and nt only the muslim ones|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan we are arguing about 2 different points|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan NO!! but most of those are condemned . the likes of ISIS seem to get more recruits every day .is that right?|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i am a muslim and i know isis are terrorist and i cant and neither cant my religion explain their action|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but what i am saying is that other people who arent muslims who commit act of terrorism such as killing kids|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan i agree. IRA ,boko haram,taliban, ISIS, neo nazis are all classes of terrorists.|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and what do you think about these recruits ?? Who are they ?? Arent they the irakis who were bombarded and their|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan families killed by the US for some oil ?? Aremt they Afghanistan people who had millions of their countrymen|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and although i hate to admit ... But u r partially correct ... Unfortunately a big part of the terrorist attacks|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan people are joining ISIS and invading a muslim country, murdering women +kids yet blame the west. no difference|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan are carried out by muslims but they radicalized after western attacks on their homes and families|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan but the middle east has always been at war with itself. my question is why can't people just accept each other?|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i dont blame the west and i certainly dont excuse their actions as terrorists but i might understand their|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan radicalization|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan at war with itself ?? How is that ??|||||@BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan : Whatever makes you makes you  happy. Thank god I live in South Africa and not the UK. Muslims here live in peace|||||@ljnicholls74 look at your own country's history and you'll see how sill you sound|||||@ohffsman so whatever happened to evolution? are we still stuck in the dark ages? why can't people accept not everyone is the same?|||||@ljnicholls74 who's we, the dark ages is a period of time specific to Europe only, you know?|||||@ljnicholls74 you reply makes no sense whatsoever wth?|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 The IRA wasn't fighting for Jesus.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston A religion that instructs the murder of any follower that chooses to leave it is obviously evil.|||||@Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 no, they were fighting 'for' the Pope against the British Crown, in their eyes anyway.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston Islam should be forbidden in the west as it's an ideology incompatible with our beliefs.|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 this is the 21st century. are human beings not evolving at all? are we still sacages who'd rather kill than live|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Where did you learn that foolishness? I do hope you didn't pay for it. It wasn't the Irish Papal Army. #derp|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 yes, in short we are exactly that. People are murdered and beaten every day that doesn't make headline news.|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 and the only thing evolving is our means to carry out those same attacks.|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 should we ignore the poor innocents in syria just so we don't harm any of the ISIS 'volunteers' ?|||||@Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 no, it wasn't,  but as far as many people were concerned it might as well have been. Much like al qaida belive.|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 no.  I supported action in Syria as it happens|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 most wars are started by a maniac who uses religion as their motive .|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 absolutely. The problem we have though is others attacking all Muslims or Catholics or Jews because of a minority|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 would be like me attacking all tv presenters because of the actions of Jimmy Saville|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 and like you say, most people involved in things like this are maniacs, religion is just a convenient excuse.|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 You're speaking ahistorical gibberish. Oh, btw: "We have avenged the prophet!"|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Your analogy would be apt if this were one attack by one person and not a long, wide pattern of jihad.|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 what about Israel?|||||@Laurence0802 @AFC_Harry34 what about israel? do they target women and children because they don't agree to a certain way?|||||@ljnicholls74 @Laurence0802 they target women and children because they don't want them on land they believe is theirs, but isn't.|||||@ljnicholls74 @AFC_Harry34 I agree! I go to Israel 3 times a year! Massively the innocent party! That was a rhetorical question|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 Bullshit. Wake up. Read up or shut up. Hamas Fatah Hezbollah amongst others want Israel wiped off the map #terror|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 honestly Harry. You are embarrassing yourself. Media swayed. Read up the factual historical background.|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 easier to support a perceived underdog. Forget that before Israel fired a bullet 10k rockets were fired @ israel!|||||@Laurence0802 @ljnicholls74 #saysitall|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 no actually it doesn't!!!!!!! Wake up.|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 look at land records. Read the mandates. The UN resolutions. Anyone can knock up a pretty graphic.|||||@Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 jimmy Saville wasn't alone in his actions either, so my analogy is sound.|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous.|||||@mdluk199 @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Much agreed.|||||@mostafaihab96 @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan Have you ever heard of Timothy McVeigh? He was called a domestic terrorist!|||||@Sports_Politic @piersmorgan That's hilarious. This type of thing happens once every 20 years in France. Twice a year in the USA!|||||@Fletch_Butcher @piersmorgan nothing hilarious about people getting killed. You are a disgrace.|||||@acb4values @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan seriously ?? U r gonna jump on a single exception ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Olympic park bombing, weather underground, Sikh Temple shooting, etc., were all listed as terrorist acts!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan by whom ?? The government or the media and the people|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Some media, but all by the government. With this President many Muslim shootings haven't been called terrorism!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan i dont care about the govt !! The federal govt acknowledged that only 6% of attacks were carried out by muslims|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan however if a person committing the same crime is NOT muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan and i think this only started after 9-11 ... Not after mcveigh !! And that the media is to blame !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan 2 Muslim attacks on military bases were called work place violence!! That's STUPID!!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan but the majority !! Even you have to admit that the media is biased about this !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan After we saw the thousands of Muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders!!|||||@acb4values what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Many attacks on our embassies and other embassies, 1st twin tower attack, USS Cole, but 9-11 final straw!!|||||@acb4values and millions of them condemning such violence !!|||||@acb4values how about we work the other way around two|||||@acb4values lets consider the US attacks on foreign soil !! Lets consider the foreign invasions !! Irak afghanistan ...|||||@mostafaihab96 What Christian attacks on schools? Where? Were they yelling Jesus is Great while they were doing it?|||||@acb4values i am sorry but how many innocent american was killed during all those attacks ?? Just a fraction of the innocents killed during|||||@acb4values the invasion of irak or afghanistan !! But you wont consider these innocent muslim people who were bombarded by your military !!|||||@acb4values i ddnt see the boston bomber yelling any religious words !!|||||@acb4values look ... Killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion !!|||||@acb4values but one thing we can agree on is that the western media is biased against muslims !! And consequently so are western people!!|||||@mostafaihab96 Where are the hundreds of Christians rioting and killing for the defilement of Christ?|||||@acb4values why would they ?? As i believe they take this event proudly !!|||||@mostafaihab96 That's funny!! They were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly!!|||||@acb4values however in islam we dont depict our prophet ... If you would like to mention our prophet then at least respect our religion|||||@mostafaihab96 So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools!!|||||@acb4values just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in cold-blood at schools|||||@acb4values not only at schools !! There are loads of examples !! The IRA the Norwegian attacker who killed 86 in a youth camp|||||@acb4values but u r from the US and the school shootings are the most things i thought you would relate to|||||@mostafaihab96 The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence?|||||@acb4values but it was never my intention to make accusations. I am merely demonstrating that psychos who kills people are everywhere|||||@acb4values and not only muslims|||||@mostafaihab96 This is true, but there are millions of Muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings!!|||||@acb4values not millions !! These are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives !!|||||@acb4values it happened before with christians with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it !!|||||@acb4values but now these groups have almost vanished and i believe this will happen to the few extremists !! And they r few compared|||||@acb4values to all the muslims in the world who believe in the religion of peace just like me !! Or do you think i am a terrorist ??|||||@mostafaihab96 Actually, I would NEVER agree with that! They rarely even mention that it was a muslim attack, especially regarding Israel!|||||@acb4values i am just happy we agree on the same concepts !! Perhaps i am too pessimistic!! But when it comes to muslims i have seen it all|||||@mostafaihab96 Most of MSM placates to Muslim extremist! Even this they're calling Islamaphobia, when phobia is irrational fear!|||||@acb4values some are really rational just like yourself whom i enjoy talking to learning how people look at us (muslims) trying to improve!|||||@mostafaihab96 IT'S NOT irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an "infidel"!|||||@acb4values but unfortunately there are also a few who would just insult me and would want to kill me !! Either way my response is the same|||||@mostafaihab96 I appreciate that, but you do need to know that acting at all like this was justified doesn't help. You seem reasonable too!|||||@mostafaihab96 We could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better.|||||@acb4values its not justified and can never be explained and i am sorry if i gave you this impression !! Perhaps it was a misinterpretation|||||@mostafaihab96 I do know that there are peaceful Muslims, but not sure if Islam is a religion of peace. None of history shows that to be.

AS YOUV'E HEARD IN PARIS ONYA BARRY O &amp; AFFILIATES ?|||||@SkyNewsBreak cut power and jam mobile  signals etc so he has no idea what is going  on from media|||||@SkyNewsBreak is it time to cut all the live TV feeds..  They are obviously watching TV for live info on police actions outside buildings .|||||@SkyNewsBreak  Agreeing with many on a total news blackout for everyone's safety .. Live streaming is giving them advantage over authorities|||||@SkyNewsBreak take the cameras away from the Charlie Hebdo scene|||||@SkyNewsBreak shld have had 24hr surveillance on these guys after #CharlieHebdo shootings|||||@SkyNewsBreak this is not surprising but agree with others media black out needs to happen|||||@SSReaney looks like you called it spot on|||||. @SkyNewsBreak - so would a news blackout not be advisable?|||||@SkyNewsBreak repeating the gunshots is better than a blackout #confusethebuggers! #flushemout!

I grieve for the fallen solider and his family, but your poor..|||||@cdnmickeyfan @CTVNews Sure, of course i'm ignorant. The fact is there're laws, u commit a crime, u are punished. not striped of ur ctzship|||||@cdnmickeyfan choice of words like "deport them" is the issue here.

Forgive him.|||||@cdnmickeyfan oh I get it your definition of being Canadian is one that doesn't include people of mid-east descent #thatsprejudice|||||@TheBeast_175 @cdnmickeyfan I seriously don't get that shortcut.  I say he can't deport them and all of a sudden I'm a behind criminals...|||||@TheBeast_175 @cdnmickeyfan I sincerely hope that is NOT  his definition of being Canadian.|||||@yensidltaw @cdnmickeyfan something tells me he's an idiot and that something are his tweets lol|||||@TheBeast_175 @yensidltaw First of all you idiot I'm a female.

You hop topics faster than you hop dicks. So have a bad day and FUCK YOU|||||@cdnmickeyfan @TheBeast_175 Killing someone no matter ur intentions behind the killing is the same to me.

Only Kosher outright refuse to stun first.|||||@manjrn @PamelaGeller What are you on about? Blackmail? If there is a demand there is money to make, so no need to blackmail.|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Haven't ever seen that. Halal is blackmail by thugs &amp; businesses that buy into it can do w/o my &amp; many others $|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Right.|||||@PamelaGeller @mskimrose Is that why #Walmart has caved to these terrorists &amp; carries halal products now?

Sounds nutty and without facts.|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - I can't remember sign but look on food all kinds &amp; it's there.

Enough is enough.|||||@PamelaGeller @TRobinsonNewEra yay for tolerance!|||||@manjrn @PamelaGeller  Reference please. Sounds like cutting costs to me.

Muslim complaints. If they don't like our country then leave.|||||@manjrn  If they were for staff use,  good on them for providing an alternative. If it was for the customers, that would be ridiculous|||||@BearyTruth - No it was for customers. Also was problems with them serving bacon. Now the bacon I haven't heard anymore. I won't buy KFC|||||@BearyTruth - Their was a list of companies that were halal compliant.|||||@manjrn @PamelaGeller As for leaving the country. Think that is an extreme reaction over alcohol wipes.|||||@manjrn So? That probably also means veterinarian.. yay for me!|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - You know it's just not that. You give them a inch they take a mile &amp; that goes for so called moderates.|||||@manjrn Coz you hate Muslims? Or love bacon. Its a business, they will work towards the customer base. Don't see the problem.|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller - Where's all the protest against all this savagery.

Are you taking about ISIS ?! Coz if so you are being ignorant as most the victims are Muslims..|||||@manjrn @PamelaGeller Lack of media coverage or you looking it up has more to do with the apparent silence.|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller-Not just ISIS but any terrorist activity.

Perhaps you forgot about 3000+ killed 9/11. Gee in most ME countries they danced on streets.|||||@BearyTruth @manjrn @PamelaGeller Why is the bombing happening ? Is it possible that it's a reaction to Islamic barbaric actions ?|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller -Why is EU having such problems. Sharia only areas &amp; courts. Women wearing sheets, no thank you. No sharia here.|||||@manjrn @PamelaGeller So how many ppl have to die before we feel satisfied? Gather you have neither been to the middle east|||||@manjrn or have any Muslim or Middle Eastern friends. Or you would know alot think its an inside job because they don't agree with 9/11 !!!!|||||@BearyTruth @PamelaGeller -Look this comes down to protecting what we have. Why would anyone take a chance of Muslim control. Women are dirt|||||@gary5014 @manjrn @PamelaGeller No. Iraq had nothing to do with AlQaida  &amp; everything to do with oil &amp; we used chemical weapons on them!|||||@BearyTruth - That's the wonderful thing about a non Muslim democratic state, we can disagree. Your not being honest with yourself.|||||@gary5014 @manjrn @PamelaGeller 9/11 was conducted Saudi Osama &amp; hijackers.. but we didn't bomb Saudi. As they sell us oil cheap.|||||@BearyTruth @manjrn @PamelaGeller Well , you got me there . I simply cannot argue any point if you want to ignore the truth .|||||@BearyTruth @manjrn @PamelaGeller Again, you are ignorant of the facts . Bin Laden was a big threat to the Saudis for many years before 9/11|||||@manjrn @PamelaGeller NO, am a realist. The problem has to be solved on both sides. You can't solve with only one party!|||||@BearyTruth - Your right, &amp; they don't want to be"fixed" they want it their way.

1990	1	I feel so much for the hostages in Sydney. I also feel for law-abiding Muslims in Australia. The backlash will be nasty.|||||@BeardedGenius yeah it sucks|||||@BeardedGenius we've gotta try &amp; hold it together.|||||@BeardedGenius Considering its Australia, yeah it will be nasty.|||||@BeardedGenius completely agree. It will be very hostile.|||||@BeardedGenius Most racist country I've ever been to. They won't react well to this.|||||@BeardedGenius Backlash has already started in some sections of the media unfortunately. No-win situation for all concerned.|||||@BeardedGenius 6 hours ago, about 3 hours into the media circus:|||||@BeardedGenius hate that there has to be backlash aimed at people who are as against the actions as most other citizens.|||||@BeardedGenius My recent RT hopefully shows faith in humanity|||||@BeardedGenius It will. The public and the media will lazily deduce that the hostage takers = muslims, therefore all muslims = terrorists.|||||@BeardedGenius always saddening to see Muslims having to denounce the actions of an extremist minority. Preempting the vitriol.|||||@BeardedGenius there's a group that calls themselves the "Australian Defence League" that's threatened violence against Islamic Aussies|||||@BeardedGenius oh and just for reference Strathfield isn't too far from Sydney's CBD iirc. I live in Melb so not au fait with Sydney suburbs|||||@BeardedGenius Backlash will be horrid. News outlets already calling Shahada an extremist flag. Muslim women, like always, will be targeted.|||||@BeardedGenius Only one 'terrorist' in there holding more than 10 hostages?|||||@BeardedGenius Example.|||||@BeardedGenius the vile, hate filled racist BS has already started unfortunately.|||||@BeardedGenius|||||@BeardedGenius some of the ignorance going around is astounding. News Corp media down here not helping either.|||||@D_Espinoza @BeardedGenius some of the journalism this afternoon has been below gutter level|||||@JamesK_1312 @BeardedGenius that and all wild speculation. The stuff about the "Islamic" writing on the flag. ffs it's just Arabic.|||||@JamesK_1312 @BeardedGenius Indeed in has. On par with the social media commentary that surrounds Australia Day.|||||@D_Espinoza @BeardedGenius just goes to show, of you're a mentalist with a craving for media coverage, bust out the muslamic fancy dress....|||||@JamesK_1312 @BeardedGenius the aussies are as racist as they come...

I think Religion is being used as the excuse here for gaining money and power, much as it always has.|||||@ayhandagci Some ppl are brainwashed by it and exploited by others much as they always have been.|||||@DistantPylon believe me if they fall marty, jihadist think they will go directly to heaven  where girls with big eyes wait for them.not jke|||||@ayhandagci I know and these ppl have their uses when under the control of smarter ppl who stand to gain great wealth and power.|||||@DistantPylon .you are right about money power etc.but main problem is the religion which lead people to jihad and "heaven" full of girls...|||||@DistantPylon solution is simple.europe and USA must back secularism in middleeast.instead of supporting these islamists.|||||@ayhandagci I wish it was simple. I wish secularism did exist in the middle east.|||||@DistantPylon even in my" secular" country, Turkey, the west supported islamist erdogan and we are now like iran.so i hate USA and EU...|||||@DistantPylon the west began promoting islamism after 1950s against "communism danger".and they still promote it!icant believe.|||||@sammcgraw @MazurekRob @CNN Who cares, the terrorist/rapist is now dead.  What he wants no longer matters AT ALL|||||@ayhandagci  you musnt hate Americans or Europeans because of the end product of their successive governments. Hate is part of the problem|||||@DistantPylon sorry i didnt mean the public.but their goverments.especially USA...they deserve the hate of seculars in middleast.|||||@GillianBauer3 @sammcgraw @CNN -Yeah the whole situation is about as real as the Ottawa shooting was (another orchestrated false-flag)|||||@ayhandagci @CNN most of the civilians dont back these islamists. Please seperate the goverment from the general people|||||@Williamnewport of course. i mean USA goverment and other western countries policymakers backs islamism since 1950s.sorry for mistelling.|||||@ayhandagci @CNN Well according to rumour Saudi's financed 9/11 -whether there is actual evidence to support that however - is another story|||||@MazurekRob you must not doubt that. the finance sources of jihadists are saudis and gulf states and recently turkey in syria.|||||@ayhandagci -I dont doubt it- what im saying is there is no hard documented evidence as of yet that ive seen to support it in hard evidence|||||@ayhandagci -But I do not doubt for a second that the Saudi's were not behind financing 9/11.|||||@ayhandagci -However without hard evidence to back up finanacing theories - one cannot physically prove such theories -thus its speculation|||||@MazurekRob  hard because cia mossad gulf states work tohether.this was a coalitn against communism but now i dont undrstand what thr aim is|||||@ayhandagci -This was nothing but Global false-flag to conquor nations&amp; form NWO Govt -its Very obvious to anyone with their eyes wide open|||||@MazurekRob but how they feed a monster who eat its feeder?in libya usa embs.killed and isis kills westerns in syria.|||||@MazurekRob what is NWO?|||||@ayhandagci AMB stevens and Seals were set-up &amp; purposely "Abandoned"  because they knew too much about Obama arming ISIS with weapons|||||@ayhandagci -all the beheadings of journalists were "FAKE" /STAGED - You notice film always fades out to black before any actual beheading|||||@ayhandagci -New World Order - Comprised of Freemason Elitists,(Rothschilds,Rockefeller,CFR types,Royalty,Satanists)-|||||@MazurekRob so what do you think about  Turkey's stuation?erdogan also support isis el qaide in syria.is erdogan to be like mursi?|||||@MazurekRob @GillianBauer3 @CNN both blocked for stupidity.|||||@ayhandagci -Turkey is a Nato ally -Which means they will do whatever they're told by UN/U.S. and 100% onboard with global false-flag agenda|||||@sammcgraw @GillianBauer3 @CNN - speaking of stupidity-Sam should stop watching Mainstream media and actually do some research on his own

2006	1	Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates are still in place to encourage drivers to get into the CBD.|||||@Uber_Sydney hikes prices during the #sydneysiege. How is that helping? Giving away free rides would help.|||||@Uber_Sydney thank you for fixing this situation.|||||@Uber_Sydney Trying to get in contact, anyone at the phones?|||||@Uber_Sydney that's like the most confusing statement ever. The social media department of Uber Sydney is high or something?|||||@Uber_Sydney you really gotta stop the swarm model or at least have someone actually look at WHY an area is swarming.|||||@Uber_Sydney how about paying your drivers extra to go into the cbd instead of forcing others to pay extra to travel into potential danger?|||||@Uber_Sydney swarming because of a concert or event? Fine. Swarming during a hostage crisis? NOT COOL.|||||@Uber_Sydney @mtats so is uber paying for the rides paying the drivers?|||||@Uber_Sydney So are rides free or more expensive? Your tweet is very unclear|||||@Uber_Sydney who's paying then?|||||@universe93 @Uber_Sydney calm down its one cafe.|||||@Uber_Sydney what does this mean?|||||that's better RT @Uber_Sydney: Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates still in place to encourage drivers|||||@EnglishEmma it's still raising prices when people are trying to leave the CBD in a crisis. At least they've made rides free now|||||@universe93 is public transport free?|||||@Uber_Sydney so free or surge pricing? #confused|||||wait, does 'higher rate' mean what @Uber_Sydney is paying drivers? #clarification|||||@Uber_Sydney reports around the world flooding in of your 400% fare increase in response to a siege situation, smart.|||||@alfinitum @Uber_Sydney Yeah I think so. They're getting $100+, riders aren't wearing diff. Good gesture. Poor message transmission|||||@EnglishEmma nope. I respect them for making the rides free, I can also see how they wanted to get more drivers in|||||@DrYobbo initial message did imply that riders can cop hike. Much better. @Uber_Sydney|||||@universe93 so our GOVERNMENT is making money from people trying to get out of a hostage situation but you don't shout and yell at them...|||||@universe93 but you do Uber for trying to increase drivers. My work here is done your honour.|||||@Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney What do you pay your drivers?|||||.@iGottaTravel @Uber_Sydney @mtats Seems. A global marketing disaster Uber is trying to fix.|||||@nicholasderoose @Uber_Sydney you're aware that this tweet ...is giving away free rides, right?|||||@beck_sullivan @Uber_Sydney Glad I'm not the only one who's confused ...|||||.@EnglishEmma @universe93 Every #taxi can take a M40 $30 discount voucher. But then #guber isn't public transport.|||||@el1nor @Uber_Sydney Uber is.|||||@andrewv @Uber_Sydney the surge rates are to draw the drivers there (uber will pay the cost).

Enjoy your walk. @Uber_Sydney|||||@life19082492084 don't know if your being sarcastic or going of topic|||||@EnglishEmma You called uber public transport, it's not. PT is for everyone not just the elite.|||||@beck_sullivan The rides are free. @Uber_Sydney will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket.|||||@life19082492084 I never called uber PT. Everyone is having a go at Uber but not PT... We own it,we shouldn't have to pay in desperate times|||||@Umair_Bilal @Uber_Sydney I'm baffled by how few of its customers actually know how Uber works.|||||@JonnyPut @Uber_Sydney for the transport service I don't run? Excellent point sir. If they wanted to save money, they should've kept quiet.|||||@EnglishEmma U don't pay extra for PT at desperate ‚åö. My apologies if I got the issue confused. I agree PT for everyone regardless of class.|||||@MWhalan for sure|||||@life19082492084 people expect Uber drivers to work for normal/free in "crisis times" but when Uber increases prices 2 get more drivers than|||||@NicoleWill100 @Uber_Sydney It is an illegal bloody service. Why don't you thank regular taxi drivers?Encouraging theft are we?|||||@life19082492084 everyone cries how bad it is... Yet public transport is still usual price and no one is whining at them.|||||@life19082492084 Same people pro do sweet all but moan on social media about how terrible everyone else is.. And yes irony burning my end.|||||@EnglishEmma I see your point. Maybe @TransportforNSW should make transport free from the CBD today.|||||@Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney That is the point, dummy. Lots of drivers signing up for Uber. They are smarter than you. So help out and shut it|||||@EnglishEmma This is a ubers drivers forum, not sponsored by uber. Read what it's like in a mature uber market.|||||@EnglishEmma I'm kinda new to (active) twitter but I can see the praises of a knee jerk reaction. It highlights the collective mind issues.|||||@JonnyPut @Uber_Sydney wow, what an asinine remark. They went for a PR scoop and fucked it, now they're scrambling to fix it. Seems smart|||||@JonnyPut @Uber_Sydney how about you fuck off back to your corner of the internet where your opinion matters and I'll do the same.|||||@Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney Listen up dum-dum.  They ARE paying the drivers more. Reading is a skill.|||||@Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney Man, you're dumb.

2254	1	What does the black flag at #SydneySiege stand for?|||||@BBCWorld It is an innocuous religious thing, something about there being one god, and muhummad being the prophet...|||||@BBCWorld So it's just Muslims in general we should be concerned about, nothing to do with identified terrorist groups.|||||@BBCWorld|||||@BBCWorld important point: similar but different to ISIS folks. Not the same thing, probably just a single disconnected nutbag.|||||@havanadump @BBCWorld no. Dipstick, it's nothing to do with muslims in general.|||||@Greebobek @BBCWorld Perverted Vision? They follow the book. Fact is, it's not a very nice book. Hate Speech|||||@rbp77 @BBCWorld It has everything to do with Muslims in general. Are you another communist? You lot are out in force today.|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld About as nice as the Bible.|||||@BBCWorld - #getthemhomesafely|||||@Scorpydog @BBCWorld Clearly not so innocuous as far as the perpetrators here are concerned.|||||@havanadump @BBCWorld oh you're a professional troll - in lieu of having an actual purpose in life? Evolve or die already.|||||@Greebobek @CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld it's a book on how to conduct life, and sometimes life isn't nice, hence why we should pursue peace|||||@Greebobek @CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld now then anyone else gutted that this is all happening in a chocolate shop... üíî|||||@BBCWorld IDIOTS! What they are doing opposes the very banner they are putting up! Did Allah or Prophet Muhammad SAW tell u 2 do that? !|||||@Greebobek @BBCWorld No not really. But then we've grown up and dumped it. About time they did the same|||||@JonBenja @BBCWorld I mean innocuous in so far as the flag is actually just like a muslim prayer cloth. Its use here is awful.|||||@rbp77 @BBCWorld Not a troll, just have a different opinion to you. All communists identify dissent as trolling.|||||@BBCWorld that there's an idiot with a black flag. What is #bbc trying to imply? "BOO! IT'S A TERRORIST! BE AFRAID LIKE THE SHEEP YOU ARE!"|||||@o0alchemist0o @Greebobek @BBCWorld A book promoted by a known, War Lord &amp; Rapist. Nice start to a religion|||||@havanadump @rbp77 Hey Ross. How about a bum root? By the way, if you knock me back you're a homophobe.|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld okay so who was raped and warlord? You've been reading to much out of context material #ignorent|||||@o0alchemist0o @Greebobek @BBCWorld Oh, youre gonna re write history......ignorant? Pot Kettle|||||@o0alchemist0o @Greebobek @BBCWorld You tell me. Are there rules when it's okay &amp; not okay to rape women, in THAT book?|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld well the qu'ran I read does not condone rape, adultery and abuse of women, the most U can do is...|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld is use the force of a small stick on a shoulder as a last resort, so what "rape" are you talking about?|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld I don't need too tbh, it seems your account for knowledge is skewed. I think u need to find better reading material|||||@o0alchemist0o @BBCWorld Hadith 4.24. By the way Ignorant is not spelt with an 'e'|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 I suggest u should maybe approach someone that is a qualified Islamic scholar, who can provide theological based u need|||||@o0alchemist0o Even this conversation is disturbing in itself. That the ambiguity over rape &amp; Islam even exists, is so sad|||||@Scorpydog @JonBenja @BBCWorld why does the caption above photo say it symbolizes engagement in jihad.|||||@DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld because they are misinformed. Muslim woman came on tv HOURS ago and explained that it was NOT the ISIS flag|||||@DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld sorry IS flag, whatever...brain is exploding|||||@havanadump @BBCWorld as far as I can tell, the letters are certainly Arabic but they're gibberish, strung together randomly.|||||@ayeshapowell @BBCWorld So you're saying it's Arabs that are the problem?|||||@havanadump @BBCWorld I'm saying in this picture, specifically, someone doesn't know how to write syntactical Arabic.|||||@ayeshapowell @BBCWorld Plenty of people in Australia who don't even know how to write syntactical English.|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 @BBCWorld and what book of had its, not all Hadith are authentic btw.|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld The BBC also say that. They say similar but not the same.|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld  PS yes holding it up for some reason.|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 last time I checked that wasn't in the Quran, women are highly respected. +|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 +And secondly, don't forget the bible though it was okay to stone babies|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 Islam will never condone rape or any other abuse, like I said, opinions of twisted schoolers and unauthentic hadiths can't|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 speak for a religion. You know the difference between Hadith and the qu'ran right?|||||@bathsaltsniall Yes, and we've dumped that book &amp; become a secular society. And there are rules on rape in the book|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 I mean think about it logically, how can a society that the qu'ran wanted to lead exist with things like barbarism and rape.|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 like I said u should get your questions and approach some educated Islamic scholars or theologians who can give u the awsners|||||@o0alchemist0o I might be wrong, but one is written by a God, and one by men? I've no religion|||||@o0alchemist0o well what I would say, Islam has held back these societies. Like Christianity did in Europe, in the Middle Ages|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 you're probably not even muslim how would you know and understand rules in and out of the book??!|||||@MwattinLeebi @BBCWorld Muhammad and the early Muslims presided over a great deal of massacres, rape and slavery actually.|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld Not being the IS flag does not means it's not a banner for Jihad. Jihad is pretty central to|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja @BBCWorld Islam. That's the unpalatable truth the right-on brigade continue to skirt round.|||||@o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld Maybe the rape and sexual enslavement justified here:|||||@o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld And practiced by Islamic State, Boko Haram etc.|||||@o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld Also, there is no such thing as marital rape in Islam.|||||@o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 Yea, maybe a qualified scholar like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a PHD in Islamic Studies.|||||@bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 Why are there Hadiths that say that most of the residents of hell are women who were ungrateful to their|||||@bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 husbands if they're so respected in Islam? When 90% of all murder, violence, oppression and rape in history|||||@bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 falls at the feet of men?|||||@_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 ask that to other men, the bible thought it was okay to stone babies but that ain't none of my business|||||@bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 What proportion of Christians do you think believe the Bible is infallible today? How many even know stuff|||||@bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 like that is in there?|||||@bathsaltsniall @CRAIGPARSONS2 Now: how many Muslims believe the Qur'an to be the infallible command of Allah?|||||@_Maleven there are many verses opposite of that and, as many don't understand, verses have multiple meanings and different interpretations|||||@bathsaltsniall Course they do. It's a religion of peace.|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 the qu'ran is the word of God, passed down via the angel Gabriel to Mohammed (pbuh)|||||@CRAIGPARSONS2 hadiths on the other hand are recordings of traditions and reports by the companions of the prophet Muhammad (pbuh)|||||@_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld that translation for one is not something I can explain I'll be honest.|||||@_Maleven @CRAIGPARSONS2 as for him, I doubt he will give u a level headed answer in anything.

He's on youtube|||||@o0alchemist0o @CRAIGPARSONS2 @Greebobek @BBCWorld Bullshit. Stop being such a fucking cop out. Jihad is Jihad.|||||@bathsaltsniall uh? Cos I can read|||||@bathsaltsniall @_Maleven but no one is stoning babies in 2015. Move on from that one|||||@_Maleven @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden Not ISIS, hurrah! So hostages won't be beheaded, but at risk of death by shooting.|||||@_Maleven @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden Turns out hostage taker is Iranian, so a Shia and implacably opposed to/by ISIS.|||||@JonBenja @_Maleven @DaveyBudden it is just important to get facts right, misinformation is dangerous|||||@JonBenja @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden What's your point?|||||@JonBenja @_Maleven @DaveyBudden  The hostage taker is actually just a nut job.|||||@JonBenja @Scorpydog @DaveyBudden And has he not declared himself a recent convert to Sunnism anyway? That's what I heard.|||||@JonBenja @_Maleven @Scorpydog So now we have to worry about Shiites also.|||||@Scorpydog @_Maleven @DaveyBudden Who said otherwise?|||||@DaveyBudden @_Maleven @Scorpydog Shiite happens|||||@JonBenja @Scorpydog @_Maleven From some comments I read u would think most Islamist want to have us over for tea.|||||@DaveyBudden @JonBenja @_Maleven I just dont think we should judge others based on religion, race, sexual orientation or political views|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja Get your head out of your arse. I WILL judge people if Islam or any other ideology makes them disgusting|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja bigots.|||||@_Maleven @DaveyBudden @JonBenja You'd probably want to put me up against the wall for being a "disgusting faggot" too yeah?|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja Excuse me? I think you'll find that's a common view among fundamentalist Muslims. Not me, you ignorant|||||@Scorpydog @DaveyBudden @JonBenja fucking piece of shit.

2335	1	Yes, #sydneysiege is a hostage situation. Yes, the hostage taker(s) is a terrorist. Any other stupid failures of PC that need addressing?|||||@GaltsGirl so far so good|||||@GaltsGirl @AshleyCiandella Having gone through a similar incident 2 months ago, YES this is terrorism.|||||@GaltsGirl Any chance the terrorists might be Muslim?  Welcomed into the Aussie civil society with its generosity, warmth, and tolerance?|||||@GaltsGirl what is your point exactly??|||||@GaltsGirl Yeah. How about waiting until you declare it IS terrorism?|||||@GaltsGirl Expect copycats in the US.

IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!!|||||@LeveyIsLaw Obviously you've missed the "police action" headlines.|||||@GaltsGirl which means what exactly? there's one criminal in there.|||||@GaltsGirl I'm glad that Twitter has given you the opportunity to openly display your and your followers stupidity.|||||@GaltsGirl Police shouldn't be involved in hostage situations or terrorist attacks?

Honestly.  If I'm missing something pls 1|||||@GaltsGirl link to whatever additional context I need 2|||||@LeveyIsLaw Because it's an attempt to avoid calling him a terrorists.|||||@GaltsGirl "Calling him a terrorists."  Can't actually respond to this; I don't understand it|||||@GaltsGirl If you want to try coherently reformulating that - possibly by saying who is him, or them, or why "police action" and terrorism 1|||||@GaltsGirl are mutually exclusive, go ahead.  But for now it just looks like a drunk text.|||||@LeveyIsLaw You seem to be the only one who disagrees with me so... perhaps it's not me,|||||@GaltsGirl I can't disagree with you - I don't understand what "calling him a terrorists" means. Too gramatically incorrect to make sense.|||||@LeveyIsLaw the Prime Minister was just on TV saying that they could not call it a terrorist attack. Why are you jumping her sht @GaltsGirl|||||@LeveyIsLaw six hours later and all the info about this extemist muslim prick and they still won't call it what it is @GaltsGirl|||||@MediWarrior it means that this is a terror attack and nobody wants to admit it @GaltsGirl|||||@MediWarrior why do you need more than one person involved to call it what it is? Seen the hostage video? Hello.  @GaltsGirl|||||@von_beltz @GaltsGirl there was an armed robbery in Burwood this afternoon. terrorist attack as well?|||||@MediWarrior HAVE YOU SEEN THE HOSTAGE VIDEO? @GaltsGirl|||||@MediWarrior Were they take hostages and made demands?

Get that through your thick skull|||||@MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi @MikkiL Bible changed, Quran refuses to.|||||@MrChris1980 @MikkiL I guess he lost the argument...|||||@ukipmarch @friendsofbibi @MikkiL it's still in there you fool.|||||@friendsofbibi  @MikkiL what, by saying something you disagree with?|||||@friendsofbibi @MikkiL you only support condemning one group, spreading hate.|||||@ukipmarch If he hasn't blocked you, could you tell him that he just proved my point about the left shutting down debate? @MrChris1980|||||@MrChris1980 @MikkiL You proved @friendsofbibi words. And what you see in Islam is what you see in Old Testament.|||||@MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi I don't see slavery, rape &amp; genocide on non believers in the bible. I do in the Quran though. ISIS proves it!|||||@ukipmarch you need to look harder.|||||@MrChris1980 no I don't. You need to accept that Islam the truths yourself instead of pushing it another way.|||||@ukipmarch @MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi Diff Christians don't go around pulling out an eye for an eye - Christianity is about love not hate|||||@MikkiL @ukipmarch @MrChris1980 Eye for an eye is about limits on justice, not on retribution.|||||@MrChris1980 @friendsofbibi Israel has a tiny proportion of land and used to have much bigger and yet you deny them this I love Israel|||||@MikkiL good brief you really have no idea of history do you?|||||@MrChris1980 I think you will find is you that have no idea of history and would rather support terorists than Israel democracy|||||@hail_spartacus @BBCBreaking  load of bollocks|||||@metastructured @turbogeek421 @BBCBreaking so what does that mean? Assumptions much...|||||@metastructured wrong again. These actions r politically motivated and religion being used. This hostage crap is in no religion at all.|||||@AfrasyabKhan Just because someone's interpretation of religion differs from yours doesn't make it any less religious|||||@metastructured wrong interpretation does.|||||@MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking Obviously you're too young to remember the height of Northern Ireland troubles. Catholic Priests were doing that.|||||@kmtildsley LOL stop trying to cover up the fact that you're a racist|||||@MariskaGL @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley  how peaceful and tolerant of you guys, especially Mariska, she knows all the right and wrongs|||||@godsadouchebag @kmtildsley yeah pls :(|||||@Asim_Ctl @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley In fact yes I do! üòå|||||@kmtildsley @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking you're denying it now? Or were u just trying to suck up to the racist girl??|||||@Asim_Ctl @kmtildsley @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking you don't understand things easily, do you? We already explained the difference with bigotry|||||@MariskaGL @kmtildsley @godsadouchebag Charles Darwin and inspector kmtildsley over here call that bigotry, Mariska miss empathy|||||@MariskaGL @godsadouchebag @kmtildsley yeah clearly|||||@Asim_Ctl @godsadouchebag @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking denying what ? My knowledge of English and the difference between racism and bigotry ?|||||@godsadouchebag @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking He does understand. To cover his embarrassment he is trying to stone us to death with snow|||||@Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @godsadouchebag It's like talking to a child.|||||@Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @kmtildsley ty for referring to me with one of the great minds in history who debunked the creation myth!|||||@kmtildsley @Asim_Ctl @MariskaGL @BBCBreaking he just wants to invite us to a game of nonsense ping-pong.  He obviously is great at that!|||||@NM_Rdg @BBCBreaking I'm afraid so and take your point.That said, heard the terrorists in Sidney are Iranian not Muslim at all!!|||||@MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking And the IRA weren't Christian. It didn't stop until the general public started condemning it.|||||@NM_Rdg @BBCBreaking it's bad they need to jump to their defence every time an individual/group, regardless of religion, acts like an idiot|||||@MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking The problem is that it's "spokesmen". It needs "normal" Muslims to stand up.|||||@MattBeck22 @BBCBreaking It needed that in Northern Ireland. It needs it here.

2340	1	Islamists are holding people hostage in a cafe in Sydney, Australia. Meanwhile, we wet our pants over pouring water on a terrorist‚Äôs face.|||||@kesgardner I'm wondering why is the US Mainstream media is not breaking this news.|||||@formula1uberfan @kesgardner cnn just broke it|||||.@kesgardner yes we should hold ourselves to the standards of terrorists. Well done 10/10 you're an incredible and moral human being|||||@Joseph93Hayes @kesgardner is it on tv ATM?|||||.@kesgardner #hottake|||||@kesgardner @gordonsolie well some people have GOT to WAKE UP|||||@formula1uberfan they broke the news and said it was a developing story and then cut back to regular programming. So, not anymore.|||||@Joseph93Hayes ayy ay ay. Really?|||||@formula1uberfan yea they said they'd break back into it as things develop. But so far no station besides cnn has broke it.|||||@kesgardner Those arguing that we are war criminals will only use this as more evidence that EIT radicalized moderate muslims.|||||@kesgardner You're legendary|||||@kesgardner @TScrasey I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  In the US, we make a report about it.  Other countries deny.  Asshats.|||||@kesgardner sceptical|||||@kesgardner @Silkkkkkk 2 wrongs don't make a right, and we shouldn't be stooping to their level, they are the criminals, not us|||||@kesgardner Also it's really important to debate over whether it is ISIS or not, because that makes a difference somehow.|||||No fucking way is this serious! "pouring water over a terrorists face" referring to water boarding? That is fucking unbelievable @kesgardner|||||@fearofmimes Whether it‚Äôs Al Qaeda or Boko Haram or ISIS or the Taliban, it‚Äôs all the same group of psychopaths.|||||@kesgardner you know that there's something wrong with the situation when they have no list of demands, that usually means it's a false flag|||||@Judoon_Platoon F*ck them. They deserve far worse than water boarding for what they did to this man &amp; many others.|||||@Judoon_Platoon  Hmmmm Waterboarding for info....raping kidnapping beheadings bombings for ??????????? #infidels?? #shias #sharia|||||@MooseMcKnuckle @Judoon_Platoon MUCH MUCH MORE!!!!|||||Hahaha hooooooo boy is Big J gonna have words for you when you kick the bucket @JudithAnnDe @MooseMcKnuckle
