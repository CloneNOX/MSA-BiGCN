And you're calling him brainless?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive @SkyNews You could. But the Koran specifically says to do these things. I would know, I've read it in World Literature|||||@StDxCorrosive *sigh*. It seems you actually know nothing,|||||@HA45z @Spetts_ @SkyNews you believe that gays should be hung and you're gonna call me stupid?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive Congrats two versus that represent the whole book. GG's dude.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive BUT SCHOLAR WHO HAS A DEGREE IN ALL THINGS RELIGIOUS|||||@lemonscrolls I don't, but last I heard westboro baptist church absolutely loathe gay people. And the biggest twist? They aren't muslims!|||||@StDxCorrosive you have to have studied the whole thing, but we are on twitter so unfortunately I can't screenshot the whole Quran, genius.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive Same or I would post the 75+ versus that say "kill them because they don't worship Allah."|||||@StDxCorrosive that's a verse, yes. What exactly is your point? I will have fun proving your ignorance|||||@HA45z My point, is you can't say a blatant verse stating to "kill them wherever you find them" (US, EU, ME) is taken out of context...|||||@StDxCorrosive yes I can because you still don't understand judging by how you still take things out of context.|||||@StDxCorrosive read the article. I'm pretty sure you'll still be ignorant even when you see the truth but I guess thats not my problem|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive I suppose it really means sit down and talk to unbelievers about what it means to serve Allah? If you don't like my|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive opinion on the subject. By all means, block me account so you don't have to see it.|||||@StDxCorrosive your opinion is fine, the ignorance not so much. If you read the article you'd understand the context and why it was said|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive So he replaces the word "them" with "idolaters" and that makes it okay? Yes the bible said kill idolaters but|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive only he without sin can cast the first stone.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive and I'm pretty sure it wasn't God who said that it was man.|||||@StDxCorrosive you still havent caught on. At the time Muhammed and followers were being tortured and constantly attacked.|||||@StDxCorrosive defending themselves seems pretty rational and justified, wouldnt you agree?|||||@StDxCorrosive Said what?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive That idolaters should be stone.|||||@HA45z they may loathe gays but at least they don't hang them.Your point is invalid|||||@lemonscrolls you said that I believe gays should be hung, I said I don't? How is my point invalid?|||||@HA45z don't deny the truth go to any Islamic country and say you're gay and they will kill you|||||@StDxCorrosive you aren't answering my replies that disprove yours and now you're changing the topic to stoning?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive No, I'm sorry I only saw the other reply. I'll go back and read the other replies.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive Defense vs going to another country in another time and killing possibly innocent people is different.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive War could be justified then, but when they set off bombs at a marathon or kill reporters in Paris its uncalled for.|||||@lemonscrolls it is forbidden in the Quran to be gay. It is forbidden in the bible too and punishment for it there is also death.|||||@StDxCorrosive Yes you're right, the US government and extremists do do this often. As well as the jews in Israel killing palestinians|||||@HA45z the difference is Christians don't actually do it|||||@StDxCorrosive we dont know if boston marathon was a hoax by government and in both it was a case of extremists, not true followers of islam|||||@lemonscrolls Yes, apparently they don't follow what God wants them to do, the God they claim is all knowing|||||@HA45z exactly because they realise that it is stupid|||||@lemonscrolls if you choose to believe in God/a religion you cannot just hand pick what of it you want to believe in|||||@lemonscrolls also this discussion is time consuming and going nowhere. Let us agree to disagree and be done with it :)|||||@HA45z agreed.....faze4life

It could be the prophet Dave for all I care, point is people have been killed. Twonk.|||||@liberal_leftie when was the last time an IRA member executed loads of kids in a school because they were learning?|||||@Mohameddahir12 @piersmorgan Free speech gives people the right to do so.|||||@AidanRoyale @piersmorgan always an excuse.|||||@piersmorgan ; thats just horrible.this is not the way to honour our prophet who was a man who advocated peace amongst man.|||||@AidanRoyale @piersmorgan free speech also must be cautious of tolerance, free speech  doesn't give the right to insult other religions|||||@Sports_Politic @piersmorgan If you think guns are the reason, you are a fool.

Mockery is important, ridiculing daft beliefs is important.|||||@Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale   religion is an extremely delicate subject. Its belief and a lifestyle. Insult that and you make enemies|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale extremely delicate for you. Everyone else doesn't have to adhere to how you feel|||||@BRANNAN88 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan  well not everyone one thinks like you do in the west.  The whole world isn't in the west|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Just because it is a delicate subject does not mean that it should be ignored.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan Guess what? France is in the West.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan Well here, I respect people but not their beliefs if they don't warrant respect. Simple.|||||@Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale  nobody is forcing you to be like us. You don't have to respect us BUT BE TOLERANT OF US!!!|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan no we see worse ... Remember the Norwegian catholics who killed about 100 in a youths camp ? He was labelled 1/2|||||@AidanRoyale @BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan yes it is. West isn't necessarily a geographical region|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston If you want to be tolerated, learn to tolerate gays, women, Jews, and Christians.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale says who? We aren't out killing people. Is that more noble than printing a picture?|||||@BRANNAN88 @AidanRoyale  I wouldn't go out of my means to insult Christianity.  I've get better things to do. This pple had an "agenda"|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan as a psychopath...

Doesn't mean you get..|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston But your religion is not|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan to throw tantrums and murder innocent people..if you were so comfortable in your religious faith..|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @piersmorgan You wouldn't care what anyone says about Islam. Simple.|||||@ljnicholls74 @liberal_leftie in the US this is carried every couple of month !! But they are catholics and so they're sick and nt terrorist|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale An Agenda? In comic satire? People poke fun at all religions, you just can't take it because it's yours.|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan don't misunderstand me.NOT all muslims are terrorists. but at the moment all terrorists seem to be muslims|||||@ljnicholls74 oops. Israel? Northern Ireland?|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale Id challenge Islam because it is a violent religion in its most basic form. Same with Christianity.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @BRANNAN88 That agenda being Islam.|||||@Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale  I think at your age you know that western media has got an agenda muslims|||||@Sjcrookston @AidanRoyale religion and individuals are separate entities|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan he was a lunatic. isis is a group that target vulnerable people because they can't fight back|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale they need more of an agenda. #religionofpeace|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan thats bcz the media labels any attack carried out by muslims as a terrorist attack !! But any attacker who isnt|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan is considered a sick person !! In the us school shootings and cop killings happens every couple of months but bcz|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston The media in our countries does whatever means necessary to protect Islam from criticism.|||||@AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston I doubt you've read on islam or read the Quran. Making accusations on things you don't know about is ignorance|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan they r nt carried out by muslims ... They r nt terrorist attacks !!|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Exactly, which is why I do not tolerate your religion.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Why do so many verses call for death?|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan once again they are lunatics who don't quote 'god is great'|||||@AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston evidence?|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan look at there targets. beslan. school in pakistan ,river of blood in syria, kidnapping of young girls in nigeria|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but do u consider them as terrorists ??|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan why dont u consider isis as lunatics bcz they are !!|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i know all their crimes ... Is it really different from mass murdering children at a youths camp ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan BECAUSE THEY HAVE STATED IT IS FOR A NEW ISLAMIC STATE!!! like i said, i know not all muslims are murderers|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan all people who commit acts that terrorizes should be called terrorist and nt only the muslim ones|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan we are arguing about 2 different points|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan NO!! but most of those are condemned . the likes of ISIS seem to get more recruits every day .is that right?|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i am a muslim and i know isis are terrorist and i cant and neither cant my religion explain their action|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but what i am saying is that other people who arent muslims who commit act of terrorism such as killing kids|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan i agree. IRA ,boko haram,taliban, ISIS, neo nazis are all classes of terrorists.|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and what do you think about these recruits ?? Who are they ?? Arent they the irakis who were bombarded and their|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan families killed by the US for some oil ?? Aremt they Afghanistan people who had millions of their countrymen|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and although i hate to admit ... But u r partially correct ... Unfortunately a big part of the terrorist attacks|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan people are joining ISIS and invading a muslim country, murdering women +kids yet blame the west. no difference|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan are carried out by muslims but they radicalized after western attacks on their homes and families|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan but the middle east has always been at war with itself. my question is why can't people just accept each other?|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i dont blame the west and i certainly dont excuse their actions as terrorists but i might understand their|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan radicalization|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan at war with itself ?? How is that ??|||||@BRANNAN88 @piersmorgan : Whatever makes you makes you  happy. Thank god I live in South Africa and not the UK. Muslims here live in peace|||||@ljnicholls74 look at your own country's history and you'll see how sill you sound|||||@ohffsman so whatever happened to evolution? are we still stuck in the dark ages? why can't people accept not everyone is the same?|||||@ljnicholls74 who's we, the dark ages is a period of time specific to Europe only, you know?|||||@ljnicholls74 you reply makes no sense whatsoever wth?|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 The IRA wasn't fighting for Jesus.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston A religion that instructs the murder of any follower that chooses to leave it is obviously evil.|||||@Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 no, they were fighting 'for' the Pope against the British Crown, in their eyes anyway.|||||@Mohameddahir12 @AidanRoyale @Sjcrookston Islam should be forbidden in the west as it's an ideology incompatible with our beliefs.|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 this is the 21st century. are human beings not evolving at all? are we still sacages who'd rather kill than live|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Where did you learn that foolishness? I do hope you didn't pay for it. It wasn't the Irish Papal Army. #derp|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 yes, in short we are exactly that. People are murdered and beaten every day that doesn't make headline news.|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 and the only thing evolving is our means to carry out those same attacks.|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 should we ignore the poor innocents in syria just so we don't harm any of the ISIS 'volunteers' ?|||||@Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 no, it wasn't,  but as far as many people were concerned it might as well have been. Much like al qaida belive.|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 no.  I supported action in Syria as it happens|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 most wars are started by a maniac who uses religion as their motive .|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 absolutely. The problem we have though is others attacking all Muslims or Catholics or Jews because of a minority|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 would be like me attacking all tv presenters because of the actions of Jimmy Saville|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 and like you say, most people involved in things like this are maniacs, religion is just a convenient excuse.|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 You're speaking ahistorical gibberish. Oh, btw: "We have avenged the prophet!"|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Your analogy would be apt if this were one attack by one person and not a long, wide pattern of jihad.|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 what about Israel?|||||@Laurence0802 @AFC_Harry34 what about israel? do they target women and children because they don't agree to a certain way?|||||@ljnicholls74 @Laurence0802 they target women and children because they don't want them on land they believe is theirs, but isn't.|||||@ljnicholls74 @AFC_Harry34 I agree! I go to Israel 3 times a year! Massively the innocent party! That was a rhetorical question|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 Bullshit. Wake up. Read up or shut up. Hamas Fatah Hezbollah amongst others want Israel wiped off the map #terror|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 honestly Harry. You are embarrassing yourself. Media swayed. Read up the factual historical background.|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 easier to support a perceived underdog. Forget that before Israel fired a bullet 10k rockets were fired @ israel!|||||@Laurence0802 @ljnicholls74 #saysitall|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 no actually it doesn't!!!!!!! Wake up.|||||@AFC_Harry34 @ljnicholls74 look at land records. Read the mandates. The UN resolutions. Anyone can knock up a pretty graphic.|||||@Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 jimmy Saville wasn't alone in his actions either, so my analogy is sound.|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous.|||||@mdluk199 @Mohameddahir12 @Sjcrookston Much agreed.|||||@mostafaihab96 @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan Have you ever heard of Timothy McVeigh? He was called a domestic terrorist!|||||@Sports_Politic @piersmorgan That's hilarious. This type of thing happens once every 20 years in France. Twice a year in the USA!|||||@Fletch_Butcher @piersmorgan nothing hilarious about people getting killed. You are a disgrace.|||||@acb4values @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan seriously ?? U r gonna jump on a single exception ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Olympic park bombing, weather underground, Sikh Temple shooting, etc., were all listed as terrorist acts!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan by whom ?? The government or the media and the people|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Some media, but all by the government. With this President many Muslim shootings haven't been called terrorism!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan i dont care about the govt !! The federal govt acknowledged that only 6% of attacks were carried out by muslims|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan however if a person committing the same crime is NOT muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan and i think this only started after 9-11 ... Not after mcveigh !! And that the media is to blame !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan 2 Muslim attacks on military bases were called work place violence!! That's STUPID!!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan but the majority !! Even you have to admit that the media is biased about this !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan After we saw the thousands of Muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders!!|||||@acb4values what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Many attacks on our embassies and other embassies, 1st twin tower attack, USS Cole, but 9-11 final straw!!|||||@acb4values and millions of them condemning such violence !!|||||@acb4values how about we work the other way around two|||||@acb4values lets consider the US attacks on foreign soil !! Lets consider the foreign invasions !! Irak afghanistan ...|||||@mostafaihab96 What Christian attacks on schools? Where? Were they yelling Jesus is Great while they were doing it?|||||@acb4values i am sorry but how many innocent american was killed during all those attacks ?? Just a fraction of the innocents killed during|||||@acb4values the invasion of irak or afghanistan !! But you wont consider these innocent muslim people who were bombarded by your military !!|||||@acb4values i ddnt see the boston bomber yelling any religious words !!|||||@acb4values look ... Killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion !!|||||@acb4values but one thing we can agree on is that the western media is biased against muslims !! And consequently so are western people!!|||||@mostafaihab96 Where are the hundreds of Christians rioting and killing for the defilement of Christ?|||||@acb4values why would they ?? As i believe they take this event proudly !!|||||@mostafaihab96 That's funny!! They were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly!!|||||@acb4values however in islam we dont depict our prophet ... If you would like to mention our prophet then at least respect our religion|||||@mostafaihab96 So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools!!|||||@acb4values just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in cold-blood at schools|||||@acb4values not only at schools !! There are loads of examples !! The IRA the Norwegian attacker who killed 86 in a youth camp|||||@acb4values but u r from the US and the school shootings are the most things i thought you would relate to|||||@mostafaihab96 The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence?|||||@acb4values but it was never my intention to make accusations. I am merely demonstrating that psychos who kills people are everywhere|||||@acb4values and not only muslims|||||@mostafaihab96 This is true, but there are millions of Muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings!!|||||@acb4values not millions !! These are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives !!|||||@acb4values it happened before with christians with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it !!|||||@acb4values but now these groups have almost vanished and i believe this will happen to the few extremists !! And they r few compared|||||@acb4values to all the muslims in the world who believe in the religion of peace just like me !! Or do you think i am a terrorist ??|||||@mostafaihab96 Actually, I would NEVER agree with that! They rarely even mention that it was a muslim attack, especially regarding Israel!|||||@acb4values i am just happy we agree on the same concepts !! Perhaps i am too pessimistic!! But when it comes to muslims i have seen it all|||||@mostafaihab96 Most of MSM placates to Muslim extremist! Even this they're calling Islamaphobia, when phobia is irrational fear!|||||@acb4values some are really rational just like yourself whom i enjoy talking to learning how people look at us (muslims) trying to improve!|||||@mostafaihab96 IT'S NOT irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an "infidel"!|||||@acb4values but unfortunately there are also a few who would just insult me and would want to kill me !! Either way my response is the same|||||@mostafaihab96 I appreciate that, but you do need to know that acting at all like this was justified doesn't help. You seem reasonable too!|||||@mostafaihab96 We could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better.|||||@acb4values its not justified and can never be explained and i am sorry if i gave you this impression !! Perhaps it was a misinterpretation|||||@mostafaihab96 I do know that there are peaceful Muslims, but not sure if Islam is a religion of peace. None of history shows that to be.

He picked the runner of the road!|||||@BBCBreaking Really? He left his ID? Do you not find that a bit strange? Maybe a finger print or something but his actual ID?|||||.@BBCBreaking that ID card could easily have been planted by the murderers. Hope no one innocent gets hurt.|||||@BBCBreaking highly suspicious about that personally|||||@BBCBreaking @arthurbarbato Ha! what an idiot.|||||@BBCBreaking US,European MSM present this news event as one of "troubled,deranged,angry individuals" not as an act of Islamic Terrorism.|||||@BBCBreaking @tonyblackburn like he is that stupid to leave it there..what bullshit!! shame on you blackburn for helping the NEW WORLD ORDER|||||@BBCBreaking I suspect this is, unfortunately, just the beginning of something even bigger #CharlieHebdo|||||@BBCBreaking ...Despite french journalists said they were not amateurs...|||||@BBCBreaking I always opposed ID cards.

I'm just saying this photo ID being found seems not to fit with the proposed scenario- or even logic.|||||@DebateCait @BBCBreaking such military precision that they got the wrong address to start with.|||||@jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking reminds me of the passports 'miraculously' found at scene of 911. Looking more false flag by the hour.|||||@Noopolitik @jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking can anyone say "false flag"?

But IF this is genuine the shot missed. No blood.|||||@Noopolitik @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking But the body is in the mortuary there, for people to verify from, i'm sure. Let's be practical.|||||@jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking Maybe. We don't know what happened. I'll keep an open mind.|||||@Noopolitik @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking  But remember it is a publicized event, we needn't set the flame to a clash of civilizations. It isn't.|||||@jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking EXACTLY. Some people would like us to think it is. Hence incidents like this. I wonder why..? ;)|||||@Noopolitik  You're being willfully ignorant of the geopolitical situation in large parts of South Asia and Mid-East. You're wiser than that|||||@jayanthkumarak  There are real bad guys. But on the whole people want to get along in peace. That doesn't suit some people's agenda...|||||@Noopolitik While you'd like to think so, i invite you to visit India, and Pakistan. Lots of people on either side don't want to get along.|||||@jayanthkumarak I lived in the Middle East and elsewhere. Powerful vested interests manipulate geopolitics-  most people want peace.|||||@Noopolitik The Mid-East is a geopolitical quagmire. We can have several long discussions on all this. Tweets seem insufficient.|||||@jayanthkumarak indeed- you can find me here:|||||@TroopsBackHome Not the faintest idea what you are going on about,anyhow have a great evening.|||||@tonyblackburn I was on about the New World Order.
